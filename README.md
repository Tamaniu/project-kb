# Avid Product Knowledge Base (Internal)

Private, structured reference for Avid products and versions from 2021 onwards.

## Scope

- MediaCentral family
  - Cloud UX
  - Production Management
  - Newsroom Management
  - Data Receiver
  - Web Services API (WSAPI)
  - Media Analytics
- Media Composer
- Avid NEXIS
- Stream IO
- Selected transcripts from:
  - NAB sessions
  - Wolftech / CuttingRoom material
  - Making the Media (ITV-related episodes)

## Structure

- `meta/` – product and version metadata
- `<product>/<module>/<version>/` – version-specific docs, primarily `new-features.md`
- `transcripts/` – curated transcripts relevant to news/broadcast workflows

## Conventions

- One folder per headline version, e.g. `2024.10`, `2023.12`, `2025.6`.
- Patch span (e.g. `2024.10.0–2024.10.8`) documented in the front matter of each `new-features.md`.
- All docs are written in Markdown and assume an Avid-savvy, technical audience.
