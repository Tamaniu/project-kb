MediaCentral | Media Files Plugin
 Version 2022.3.1 ReadMe
 
Introduction
The Avid MediaCentral | Media Files plugin enables Adobe Premiere Pro to access a wide range of Avid Atom media, so that Adobe users are able to edit native Avid media in place. The plugin supports intra-frame codecs like DNx and AVC-I, as well as MPEG-2 and even MPEG-4 Long GOP formats such as XDCAM, AVC-L and XAVC-Long, including growing media (EWC). This enables Production Management users to edit in place with all the various file types which can be stored on a Production Management system (including (XDCAM HD, and (X)AVC Long GOP).
The MediaCentral | Media Files plugin is mostly targeted to News editing workflows. Therefore, long sequences and hour-long source clips may affect performance.
For more information on the MediaCentral Media Files plugin, refer to the Avid MediaCentral Media Files Plugin v2022.3.0 ReadMe. It also includes installation instructions for installing the MediaCentral | Media Files Plugin for both Windows and MacOS.
