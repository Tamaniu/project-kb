# New Features in MediaCentral | Newsroom Management 2022.12

## Data Receiver

A new version of Data Receiver (v3.0) is available with support for newer encryption methods and more secure email servers.

The user interface has been simplified and now supports JavaScript to transform incoming data.

## iNEWS

A new system variable has been introduced in:

/site/dict/features

The variable is:

F_NO_MOS_ITEM_LIMIT

This should be set to 1 to allow large MOS items in production cues when using the ActiveX or HTML5 plugin in iNEWS Workstations.

By default, MOS item size is limited to 32KB to ensure proper operation with Monitor.
