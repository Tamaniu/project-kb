# MediaCentral Production Management 2023.7 – New Features

All items below are reproduced exactly as written in the source text.

## MediaCentral Cloud UX Asset Visibility

The Asset Visibility feature in the MediaCentral Search Connector section of the Interplay Administrator includes a new Relax Asset Visibility option that allows you to limit or expand on the assets returned by the MediaCentral Search app. Results are based on the settings that you select in this tool, the permissions that are configured for the users and for the database itself. For more information about how to configure these settings and for examples on how your MediaCentral Cloud UX search results might change based on these settings and permissions, see v2023.7 of the Avid MediaCentral | Cloud UX Installation Guide.

## New Setting in MediaCentral Transfer

We have added a new setting “Disable Opts UTF8” to FTP device configuration in the Configuration tool > FTP Settings. This setting disables Opts UTF8 commands when in SFTP mode. This setting is enabled by default.
