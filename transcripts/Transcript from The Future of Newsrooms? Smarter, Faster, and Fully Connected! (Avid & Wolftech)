it's been great listening to all the
different approaches everybody's taking
to some of the economic headwinds that
we're seeing in the industry and uh how
people are dealing with driving
efficiencies into their organizations
adopting story Centric news workflows um
as well as using AI to drive Automation
and again realize uh better efficiencies
um with that I want to start off with
you Wellford, will you just talk a
little bit about first and foremost What
attracted you to the CEO role at a and
then since you've been the CEO at Avid
what are some of the opportunities you
see for the company sure um so what
attracted me to it I my background um
was not from this industry my background
um previously was always working in uh
software technology companies and
industries that are going through
periods of massive transformation um and
that was um Healthcare during the
Affordable Care Act that was energy when
Energy Efficiency models were changing
uh how reimbursements were handled it
was martech when you went through
you know 10 years of digital
transformation during the um during
covid and I think what was really
attractive to me here is like you have a
similar situation where you've had um
you know where there are external
pressures Financial the way people
consuming news it's driving change uh at
a rapid Pace in this industry in a way
that hasn't you know just hasn't seen in
a long time that's my background as
coming into businesses and either
through um a rotation of R&D to drive
more innovation making build by
decisions uh for us to be able to do
Acquisitions uh open up the platforms
for Partnerships that was what was
really exciting to me here and I think
that's kind of what we're going to be
talking about here is is that change
because I think what what I saw at Avid
was again you know a vendor that's just
it's been incredibly important to this
industry for a very very long you know
for a long period of time for decades um
but it's also a platform that needs to
uh it's a product that needs to really
open up um and play well you know with
others and not and move from sort of
like we have to build it to an idea of
like look you know the world's just
changing and like we need to sort of be
able to partner and and and play well
with others and to that point right the
build or bu decision one of the
decisions certainly was a buy uh here
with Wolftech um and so Ain if you
wouldn't mind talking a little bit about
Wolftech and what you see as the benefit
for customers and for workflows now that
you're part of
avid I see that we are we are getting uh
you know know we could build a real an
turn solution uh from the um uh you know
the the idea of a story through the
whole chain including the MAM (Media Asset Management ) and  the PAM (Production Asset Management) also
the editing before we were uh supporting
everything you needed for for resource
handling and also collaboration on
story story um in initiating and then
also uh on the uh distribution part uh
know we have everything from the start
to the end of the chain and um I had a
meeting with u with our uh customer uh
one week ago and um they were talking
about what are we really delivering to
the market here and we are they said you
know we are really delivering the best
you know uh collaboration tool but also
uh the best also communication tool in
the organization because that's very
important also and also the uh the the
mobile experience that have been a game
changer for many of our customer uh to
implement the the mobile experience in
the day-to-day work and we also see that
it's very important also for the um
adoption of a product like like this for
a story centering product to to really
have a good mobile application and also
very good uh uh user
interface to get this it's centralized
to get the adoption in a good
way very cool yeah and it's no mistake
right that uh what you built right was
really attacking certain areas in the
market that you know you saw
opportunities in and that really folds
in very nicely into the MediaCentral
platform right everything that you guys
have brought to the table fills in a lot
of the workflow gaps very nicely in
MediaCentral so it's going to be really
exciting to see how that sort of plays
together so Wellford with that um when you
look at Avid's history in news and sort
of the long history that we've had how
do you think that the acquisition of
Wolftech helps bolster Aid's position in
the market yeah I think look we're
incredibly well capitalized now after
the business has gone private and we
have a very large private Equity sponsor
with a tremendous amount of uh of room
and a big part of the thesis was for us
to do um Acquisitions and to do uh open
up the platform be able to do
Partnerships um and when we sat down and
looked at you could have taken small
pieces and picked little bits along the
way but we need I felt like look we need
to go big and make a big move um and
again the work that you know uh Wolftech’s been doing at CBS and other
places um was just sort of this clear
stamp of like this is where the industry
is going this is the big need this was
the big way also for us to sort of Drive
sort of make the point with within Avid
itself of like this is where we're going
like we're opening up this is where
we're going it is going to be you know
uh first Cloud native that's we're
moving you know while made this point so
well at the last presentation of like we
also have to meet people where they are
it's not just in the cloud it's like
people some people you want to stay on
Prem you want to be in a hybrid model
and like we can accommodate that full
journey and that's where we're going but
I think at the same time it's also the
fact that like Wolftech remains open to
work with a lot of other platforms it's
not like we're just closing it off we
bringing it purely into Avid because
that is like that's what you'll see from
a lot of the other Acquisitions were
coming down the that going be coming
down the pipe for us that's great and uh
what's great about Wolftech is you can
deploy it as Wolftech you can integrate
it with Avid sooner or later it will be
integrated together on the same platform
um you have your own APIs and your own
API ecosystem which was very strong as
it is and folding that into the
organization is really great one of the
big topics certainly today though is
about Ai and how people are leveraging a
AI to drive efficiencies so uh this is a
question for both of you and I guess
I'll start with you Wellford so when you
look at AI I heard someone say it uh
well earlier in another panel which was
you know AI is both friend and foe how
do you see Ai and how do you see AI
being leveraged uh today not just in our
products but in in what you've heard
from from some of the broadcasters today
sure uh yes friend info um I think it's
you know I think for us the first and
foremost it's responsible Ai and and in
this industry it's uh it's you know
making sure that uh you know
factchecking that this every that you
have maintaining accuracy throughout the
full flow that that's incredibly
important for us a I um I think where
we're heading is how can you eliminate
sort of burdensome administrative
workflows that are there and enable
people to do uh more and more
efficiently and that's that's really
where we're planning on attacking it um
and we already have a number of AI tools
coming out in the first half of 25
between um you know Texas beach
transcription um you know a number of
other things you'll see from us I think
you know with our AI team I think
picking up pace pretty quickly so yeah
Ain how about you how do you see it and
I know I know you already have some AI
capabilities built into the product but
how do you see it yeah our focus is to
uh to to help to make a you know uh to
more for the journalist to be uh working
more efficiently and also uh telling
better stories and there's two
initiative we are working on uh one is
the journalist Integrity where we are
integrated with other party system like
the Factiverse fact-checking for
for fact checking and also Reality
Defender for picture and AI Generative deep fake checking
and um we want to make a very good
ecosystem uh to partner with the best
people in the market on this part but
also we are also developing further our
own core AI functionality into the
system also where we are also there open
to what kind of engine you want to use
in the system and then we are building
very good workflow on top of
it that's great I mean I've actually
been really proud of Avid's approach to
AI responsible AI really focusing on
efficiencies where can we use AI to
drive efficiencies as many of
everybody's been talking about today in
terms of how they're implementing that
right and Automation and I've been
really proud of the fact that we've
really focused on those areas first and
you're starting to see that uh come to
reality not just in media Central but
certainly in media composer too which
has already rolled out some AI oriented
features well you see the uh the QR code
here uh on the screen that will take you
to a page that'll give you more detail
about what Avid is doing with Wolftech
um so I encourage you to check that out
there's a lot more information about
this acquisition it's very exciting
times at Avid um I don't know if you
guys have any closing thoughts before we
uh we jump off stage Wellford I mean no
stay tuned there's a lot more to come I
this is the first and along along run
and like this industry is incredibly
important to have it and that that's it
first and foremost this is really the
reason that I came is the pace of change
the opportunities that we have uh you
know again like I said how well
capitalized we are out there I see a
Universe of technologies that we could
acquire um there are a lot of you know
smaller players that are out there with
sort of small Revenue bases but have
amazing products and I think being able
to bring uh the backing that we would
have you know to those businesses it's
it's going to be it's going to be really
fun I'm pretty excited about it I think
one important thing is also um how we
have build our product they focus on
being a layer on top of uh existing
production systems like the uh the
Rundown so we are very open to integrate
with other Rundown but also on the 
side we have a very close 
integration with iNews uh so we could
really help people to have an easier
adoption to a more Story-Centric uh system
where they could start with everything
on the top the random I could take step
by step and we are also having some uh
really exciting new things there also on
the run on side so just
follow uh the next up I I think yeah
exactly follow us on all the social
medias Wellford thank you so much for
taking the time to do this we appreciate
it thank you TV news Che for giving us
this opportunity and I know the the next
panel is about to start so thanks
everyone thanks
