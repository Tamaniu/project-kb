today I'm going to talk about some
integrations that we have at Wolftech so
first off we have data miner data miner
is amazing tool to find emerging events
and breaking news stories so we have it
integrated as feeds you can find
different sources you can find different
stories you can select something that
you found interesting and you create a
story out of it when you create a story
you automatically will track the
location of the event and the cool thing
is you can also see what happened before
that particular event so you see a bird
eye overview if you click summarize here
that takes all the content that we had
before summarizes in a digestible format
and you just get a quick overview of all
the events that have
happened it will take a little while if
it's a lot of different content that you
need to summarize but here you see the
summarization happened tool another
thing that I want to show you is um
Factiverse it's a fact checking tool that we
integrated that works on any text
segment on a story you just click on
factors and it automatically goes
through the text it analyses what is a
claim a claim is something that is
either true or false so it's not an
opinion it's something that we can
verify and then it takes it and breaks
it down into smaller parts that we can
search online and it does the online
search automatically so it does finding
the different sources you can see what
is the source that is supporting this
you can open this up you can also get a
small summary why Factiverse thinks that
that particular source is supporting
that evidence and you can also see that
some sources potentially say that that
particular claim is false then you also
just can inspect that and finally we
have the integration with cutting room
and cutting room is a fantastic tool if
you want to publish something online so
here I have a story I have a publishing
point I have a sequence and we just open
this up
it takes a while to load and then we
just take some content for example the
sphere in
here you can see that we can look at the
video it animates and the cool thing
everything in here is completely
customizable so we can clicks on on the
text we can add some exclamation marks
we can add more context we can just
delete it all of this is completely
customizable we just can move
forward too cute this text maybe needs
more exclamation marks we just add them
and the great thing is we can also
change the format the output format and
then you see that it's just
automatically been moved around it just
makes sense that the content is just
rearranged and adjusted for the format
that you want to use and if you want to
bring it out you just click render and
the beauty of the S solution is that it
renders in the background and creates
those multiple formats for you that you
can use on social media.
